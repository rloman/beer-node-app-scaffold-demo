Please run:
	$ mysql -u root -p  < ./createdb.sql
	create.package.json.txt (copy to the command line or rename to .bat or .sh to run as a script)

Then please remove the (two) files: createdb.sql and the create.package.json.txt file!!!
Since they are no longer used!!!

You may also remove this file (README.NOW.txt) now!
